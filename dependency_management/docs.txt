WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH UV

1. install packages   #  uv pip install django
   uv pip install django --project   # this will save in project.toml file


2. uv pip compile --group default - generates lock files  
 
 after that we don't need requirements.in and requirements.txt files


3. uv pip install - Installs dependencies listed in [project.dependencies]


4. uv pip add [packagge]  - this Adds a new package to pyproject.toml and installs it

5. uv pip update - this updates all dependencies


6. uv pip sync - installs version vrom uv.lock reproduciable environment



WHY IS THIS GOOD?
1. no need of requirements.txt and requirements.in file
2. environment is reproduciable with uv.lock
3. as i see operations like add, remove update is easyer
