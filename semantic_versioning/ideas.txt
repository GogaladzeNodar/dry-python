WHAT IS BASIC PARTS OF STRUCTURE?

1. - we need parser, to parse this data  1.2.0-alpha.1  or having a similar structure like this - 
[1, 2, 0, alpha, 1]   # which data structure is better for this data? i must serch this
or dict like {major:1, minor:2, patch:0, prerelease: beta, prerelease version: 1}

    1.1 - It might be better to divide it into two parts first, main and pre release
    but why? let,s think about it. 
    (maybe we can define two different equivaliation logic, firs part is numbers second one have leeters too)

2. - we must implement methods like __lt__, __gt__, __eq__ and so on.

3. logic to make comparison 
    

* one exampe in tests is '1.0.1b' - this is not standart one so we must catch errors like this.
(maybe it will be better to define vlidators or this error can be catched when we try to cast into integer)
